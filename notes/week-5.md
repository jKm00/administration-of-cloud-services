# Cloud Services Introduction

## What is a Cloud Service

_Services hosted remote_

- **on-demand** availability of **computer system resources**
- especially **data storage** and **computing power**
- without direct active managment by the user

### Essential Characteristics

- On-demand
- Broad network access - available over the network
- Resource pooling - assigned and reassigned according to consumers demand
- Rapid elasticity - both outwards and inwards
- Measured service

## Service Models

- **SaaS:** Software as a Service
  - Services like: email, authentication, etc...
- **PaaS:** Platform as a Service
  - Used for web servers or other usecases where you have the application, and need somewhere to "host it"
- **IaaS:** Infrastructure as a Service
  - Where you want to create and have control over a network. E.g. if you have multiple applications that should be ran on the same network.

## Deployment Models

### Private cloud

Cloud infrastructure is exclusive for a single oranization. OpenStack is an example. Cloud service only for NTNU students and employees.

### Community cloud

More or less the same as private cloud, only the group of users are larger, a community rather than one oranization.

### Public cloud

Cloud infrastructure is open for the general public.

### Hybrid cloud

Cloud infrastruture is compostion of two or more distinc cloud infrastructures. Combine private, community and public.
