# Waterfall to DevOps

## Waterfall

- The document flows like water
- A lot of documentation up front
- **Problem:** difficult to go back, go against the stream

_Ops guys have usually fallen back to a waterfall like workflow, whilst the dev guys wants quicker releases with more feedback. So theres a conflic between the two._

## Silo anologi

- Departments tend to create a silo, meaning they only focus on their goals
- Wall of confusion: a wall between the departments (between dev guys and ops guys)

## Monolith vs microservices

- From a hierarchical organization structure, to cross-functional team structure
- Each team works on one microservices

## DevOps

```
-> plan -> code -> build -> test -> release |
|                                           |
^--- deploy <---- operate <---- monitor <----
```

- Plenty of tools for each step in the devops cycle
  - Plan
    - Figma
    - UML -> draw.io
  - Code
    - Jira
    - Git
  - Build
    - maven
    - gradle
  - Test
    - JUnit
    - Cypress
  - etc, etc
